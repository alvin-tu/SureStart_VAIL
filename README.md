# SureStart_VAIL

This repo is for the SureStart Virtual AI Learning program. It is a program where students learn AI skills 
through a curated, interest-led, self-paced curriculum. Then, students are placed into small teams to develop 
AI-based solutions to real-world problems in a makethon. 

I hope to take away from this program a deeper understanding of Machine Learning. The repo will be updated 
as I go through this program, and I wish to bring value to advancing the world's technology in my future!
